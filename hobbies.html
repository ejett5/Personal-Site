    <h2>Woodworking</h2>
    <p>In a contrast to working with modern technology slowing down and enjoying traditional woodworking is a 
        great way to unwind while making something for my friends and family.
        There is also a soothing rhythm to everything when working the wood that is beautiful.
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWwltcYSHc0&t=008s">Future Projects</a> are always good and give me something to look
    forward to. Anything I do for my family is worthwhile, and more rewarding when I see the smiles on their faces.    
    </p>

    <p>There is also a satisfaction of doing a task that requires concentrated effort that is different from daily tasks and different way of thinking with the immediate
      reward of seeing how the action comes into reality.
