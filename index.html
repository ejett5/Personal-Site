    <h1>Welcome and Hello There! 
    </h1>

    <p>Thank you for visiting my site. My goal with this page is to show 
        the skills I have learned thus far and begin a conversation with you.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a software engineer with a goal of finding solutions for customers in an evolving technical landscape.
        My primary focus at this time is with web application development as more and more of our technologies are becoming
        more interlinked in ways that are so subtle the transition is seemless.
    <hr>
        With a personal background spanning from the military, medical services, search and rescue and even a spa settings. I have a wide range of experience to pull from and leverage when
        we are looking for a solution. There is a nice balance and harmony of having the a good focus while allowing the imagination
        to wander and explore the infinite possibilities that exist. Having many experiences is a great benefit to see things from many different perspectives especially when working with those from various backgrounds.
        <br>
        <h3> Career Goals</h3>
        <br>
        I aim to provide full services to customers and clients so that they may have as much customisation that
        they may need for their requirements. For now starting with web apps then evolving to include machine learning.
        My current languages are javascript, some python, markup languages such as HTML and CSS.
        <hr>
        <h3>Projects</h3>
        This website! This project highlights my ability to use multiple web technologies to develope a web page. This includes key functions of seperate pages, and java events.
        <br><br>
        RTV Database, the login page and a sample of data entry are included here. I have a vision of how this can be used in a practical application and I will continue to work towards making that.
        This is set to open in a new window as well as eventually it will be it's own standalone applicaiton.
